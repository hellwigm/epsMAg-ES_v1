# epsMAg-ES
Matlab code of the epsMAg-ES for constrained optimization problems

The epsMAg-ES represents a novel Evolution Strategy for constrained optimization that combines the the recently suggested Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (MA-ES) with successful constraint handling techniques from the field of Differential Evolution. Being applied to the benchmark problems specified for the CEC 2018 competition on constrained single objective real-parameter optimization, the algorithm is able to find feasible solutions on more than 80% of the benchmark problems with high accuracy.
